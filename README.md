# 3D-Facial-Recognition-2D-Cameras
3D Facial Recognition Powered by 2D cameras - The application is designed to develop a cutting-edge 3D facial recognition system that uses Advanced depth estimation algorithms that are implemented to transform 2D images into 3D representations of faces

Real-time Face Detection and Analysis using OpenCV, SimpleFacerec, and Mediapipe
This project is a Python script that uses computer vision libraries such as OpenCV, SimpleFacerec, and Mediapipe to detect faces in real-time video feed from a webcam. It then performs face recognition and face mesh analysis on the detected faces.

# Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- SimpleFacerec
- Mediapipe
- TensorFlow

# Installation:
_Install the required libraries using pip:_
-  ``` pip install opencv-python```
- ``` pip install mediapipe```
-  ``` pip install tensorflow```
- ``` pip install face_recognition``` 

# Usage
_Run the script using the command:_
